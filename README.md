#### Process before editing code

- In github roadmap, write "(YOUR NAME HERE) is working on this" and sendout slack in group (potentially asking for partner)"
- `git pull` get all the latest updates from master
- `git checkout -b <your_branch_name_here>`

#### Process before trying to submit any code:
- `npm run format` (auto format your code before pushing up)
- `npm run lint` (fix your lint errors)
- `npm run test <yourNewFile.spec.js>` (make sure your code passes the test your wrote)
- `npm run test` (check to see if nothing else is broken)
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "<your message here with what you added/changed>"`
- `git push origin <your_branch_name_here>`

#### Process after pushing branch

- Go into github and look at pull requests tab (you should see your branch having changes)
- Select compare and pull
- Open up Travis to see the build of that branch
- Wait for test cases to pass (all cases should pass on Travis)
- Create pull request
- On right side of page, add reviewers (add one reviewer)
- Assign yourself as the assignee
- Wait for reviewer to comment on code
- If the reviewer approves, resolve conversation, if not make changes
- confirm merge
- After merge is complete, check Travis again to see if code passes tests
- delete checked out branch

#### If there is a merge conflict

- Assign Reviewer and Assignee as normal
- Go over code to make sure it passes and looks okay
- With Reviewer, go over merge conflict and resolve conflict
- Merge
- Wait for Travis to complete again with reviewer
- After passing, merge pull request and confirm merge
- delete that branch
